There is nothing mysterious or complicated about composting. In fact, composting, or decomposition, occurs all the time in the natural world. Decomposition occurs because of the action of naturally occurring bacteria, fungi and invertebrates.\n\nThe nutrients, which were once part of the living plant or animal, are returned to the soil or water where they are able to support the growth of new plants. Composting is nature's recipe for recycling.\n\nComposting has many benefits for the environment because:\n• composting food and garden waste saves valuable landfill space\n• compost can be used as fertiliser on your garden\n• compost improves the condition of soils\n\nOver half of our household garbage is made up of food and garden waste. Most of this waste can be composted either in compost heaps or worm farms.\n\nIn the right conditions, a home composting heap can accelerate the natural process of decay. As bacteria and fungi feed and multiply, they give off a great deal of heat. In commercial composting systems, the temperature can reach as high as 70oC in the central core!\n\nWhen the temperature drops, invertebrates such as worms and millipedes enter the heap and complete the process of decomposition.\n\nIn a pile of mature compost, there may be a wide variety of invertebrates present. In fact, there is a mini food web in action. Some creatures, such as springtails, millipedes, mites, slugs and earthworms, feed on the partly broken down materials. Other creatures, such as spiders, centipedes and scorpions, prey on the plant feeders, creating a balanced ecosystem."
